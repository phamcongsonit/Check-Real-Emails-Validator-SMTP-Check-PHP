This time I need to do a real email checker tool, there are many such tools online but it is not completely free and it is not sure of the information security, so I created it myself
You can use that source to check free bulk emails (good use with @gmail.com), if you want to check many other servers, please use 3rd services
I will record video when I am working, it maybe help something for you
Thank you codexworld to share source
